# 🔧 Duplicate User Preferences Fix

## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified**

The system was creating duplicate user preferences because:

1. **Auth Callback** (`/lib/auth.ts`) creates preferences during sign-in
2. **User Preferences API** (`/api/user/preferences/route.ts`) ALSO tried to create preferences as fallback
3. **Multiple Sign-in Events** could trigger the auth callback multiple times
4. **No Deduplication Logic** - the old `upsert` only checked `userId`, not `spotifyId`

## ✅ **Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Fixed Root Cause - Prevent Future Duplicates**
- **Enhanced `createDefaultUserPreferences`** function:
  - ✅ Checks for existing preferences by BOTH `userId` AND `spotifyId`
  - ✅ Updates `userId` if existing record has different one
  - ✅ Skips creation if preferences already exist
  - ✅ Better logging to track what's happening

- **Removed Duplicate API Call**:
  - ✅ `/api/user/preferences` no longer creates preferences
  - ✅ Only auth callback creates preferences during sign-in

### **2. Enhanced Auth Flow**
- **Better Logging**: Track exactly when and why preferences are created
- **Error Handling**: Won't prevent sign-in if preference creation fails
- **Single Point of Truth**: Only auth callback creates preferences

### **3. Comprehensive Cleanup Tools**

#### **Individual User Fix** (`/api/user/fix-my-duplicates`)
- Smart duplicate detection
- Keeps record with valid userId
- Copies custom slug from duplicates before deleting
- Safe for individual users

#### **System-wide Cleanup** (`/api/admin/cleanup-all-duplicates`)
- Finds ALL users with duplicates
- Prioritizes records with valid userIds
- Preserves custom slugs
- Bulk cleanup for entire system

### **4. Admin Panel Updates**
- **New "Auto-Fix My Duplicates" Button**: One-click fix for your account
- **System-wide Cleanup Button**: Fix all duplicates across all users
- **Better Analysis**: Shows which record is being used

## 🎯 **To Fix Your Current Issue**

### **Option 1: Quick Individual Fix (Recommended)**
1. Go to `/admin` → "Duplicates" tab
2. Click **"Auto-Fix My Duplicates"** (green button)
3. This will:
   - Keep the record with userId "lawsonhart"
   - Copy the slug from the wrong record
   - Delete the duplicate

### **Option 2: System-wide Fix**
1. Go to `/admin` → "Duplicates" tab
2. Click **"Clean Up All User Duplicates"** (red button)
3. This fixes duplicates for ALL users in the system

### **Option 3: Manual API**
```bash
POST /api/user/fix-my-duplicates
```

## 📋 **What Was Wrong in Your Case**

From your screenshot:
- ✅ **Record 1** (CORRECT): userId: "lawsonhart", slug: "lTfmWQj"
- ❌ **Record 2** (WRONG): userId: "669b85a958d69629e065cfe9", slug: "sJNDiUwW"

The system was reading the **wrong record** (Record 2) because it was created later and queries might return it first.

## 🚀 **Prevention Going Forward**

With these fixes:
- ✅ **No more duplicate creation** during sign-up
- ✅ **Proper validation** before creating preferences
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** via cron jobs
- ✅ **Better error handling** and logging
- ✅ **Admin tools** to monitor and fix issues

## 🤖 **Cron Job Integration**

The daily maintenance cron job (`/api/admin/maintenance`) now includes:
- Duplicate detection and cleanup
- User account linking validation
- Malformed userId fixes

Set up your cron-job.org to call:
```
https://your-app.vercel.app/api/cron/maintenance?secret=YourSecret
```

## 🔍 **Testing**

After deployment:
1. **Test sign-up** with a new account - should only create ONE preference record
2. **Check existing users** - duplicates should be automatically cleaned up
3. **Monitor logs** - detailed logging shows exactly what's happening
4. **Run admin tools** - use the new buttons to verify everything works

The duplicate creation issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
